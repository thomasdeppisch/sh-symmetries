# Symmetries in Complex-Valued Spherical Harmonic Processing of Real-Valued Signals
This repository numerically validates and gives examples on how to apply the symmetries of complex-valued spherical harmonic (SH) and circular harmonic (CH) expansions given in

Considering these symmetries in signal processing algorithms that involve complex-valued SHs (or CHs) and are based on real-valued (time-domain) signals significantly reduces the required computations and memory.
